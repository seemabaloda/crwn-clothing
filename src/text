import { only } from "node:test";

const source = useMemo(() => ({ uri: props.url }), [props.url]);
 const {isOffline} = useNetwork();
above there are two line and below you give this statement
We can replace this line with useNetwork({onReconnect: () => setLoadState(LoadState.LOADING)});

please explain it which we need to change because if we change only 

const {isOffline} = useNetwork();
this line then it is okay but i don't get the point to replace this line

const source = useMemo(() => ({ uri: props.url }), [props.url]);
